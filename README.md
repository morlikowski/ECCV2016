# Caffe for "Generating Visual Explanations"

Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind.
It is developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center ([BVLC](http://bvlc.eecs.berkeley.edu)) and community contributors.

Framework development discussions and thorough bug reports are collected on [Issues](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues).

Happy brewing!

## Code changes

There was an error with an undefined function ´SampleLayer<Dtype>::Forward_gpu´. To circumvent the error, I've declared that function (with an empty body), as I am not running the model on a GPU for now. The error was ([reported](https://github.com/LisaAnne/ECCV2016/issues/2)) on the original repo.

## Installing on Ubuntu 16.04

The included Makefile, Makefile.config.ubuntu.16.04 and CMakeLists.txt have been configured for an installation on Ubuntu 16.04 (without GPU) as described in [this installation guide](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/wiki/Ubuntu-16.04-or-15.10-Installation-Guide).
